# project

This project is intended to convert a Tronxy 3D printer into a syringe extruder capable of extruding material like clay, dough, chocolate, or frosting from a plastic syringe.  The design is intended to re-use the existing stepper motors in a new configuration with mostly 3D printed parts. The CAD  is done in OpenSCAD.

The initial design will use a plastic 60cc syringe that may be increased to 150cc if initially successful.
